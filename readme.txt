Make it easy for customers to subscribe to your Campaign Monitor mailing lists using any of the 5 elegant sign-up forms.

== Description ==
Campaign Monitor for Wordpress allows your visitors to sign up to lists in your [campaignmonitor.com](https://www.campaignmonitor.com?utm_source=wordpress-plugin&utm_medium=referral) account, so you can create, send and measure the impact of your email marketing campaigns.
 
With our plugin, you can create and customize subscribe forms from your WordPress dashboard, decide when and where to show them, and A/B test which one attracts more subscribers.
 
* Slide-Out — Position a floating tab at the top, bottom, left or right of the screen. Clicking it will slide out a subscribe form.
* Lightbox — Overlay a subscribe form while dimming the background of the site. You can show it immediately, after a specific amount of time, or after a user has scrolled a specific amount of pixels or percentage of the page.
* Bar — A strap along the top or bottom of a page, that contains all the fields needed to sign up.
* Button — Generate a button shortcode and insert it in a page or post. The form will appear as a Lightbox.
* Embedded — Generate a shortcode and add your signup form in a page or post.
